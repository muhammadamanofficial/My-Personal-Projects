        <h2 class="biodynamic_detail_main_heading">3. Biodynamic Gardening</h2>
        <h3 class="biodynamic_main_para_heading">How To Get Started in Biodynamic Farming. :</h3>
        <p class="biodynamic_main_paragraph">The institute of Biodynamic Farming in the UK recommends three years of land preparation as the start of the process. These include all the homeopathic preparations, sprays, and soil preparations. You’ll also need to prepare your compost on-site, as well as green manure and microbial life.</p>
        <p class="biodynamic_detail_paragraphs">
            <span>1. Harness The Forces Of Nature. :</span>
            Biodynamic farmers believe that there are cosmological forces at play that help us produce our food, alongside the forces of the earth, such as biology, physics, and chemistry. Harnessing the power of the different phases of the moon, seasonal and celestial cycles are what sets this system apart from the others.
        </p>
        <p class="biodynamic_detail_paragraphs">
            <span>2. Learn To Look And Listen.</span>
            The first and most important step in getting into biodynamic farming is to learn by doing. Try to relish the shift in paradigm instead of being intimidated by it. The most important skills to develop if you’re looking to begin biodynamic farming are your instincts. Learn to look and listen to what the land and plants need by monitoring them throughout the year and picking up on the signs that they are sending you as to their needs.
        </p>
        <p class="biodynamic_detail_paragraphs">
            <span>3. Limit Interventions :</span>
            If you’ve set yourself up right, you shouldn’t have to intervene in the natural processes too much. Farm biodiversity is meant to be organized in such a way as to support itself from the land. Physical interventions should usually be unnecessary and chemical interventions should be avoided at all costs.
        </p>

        <p class="biodynamic_detail_paragraphs">
            <span>4. Spend Time On The Land every day. :</span>
            Biodynamic farming urges us to spend time on the living soil every day, paying close attention to the changes that take place on a daily, weekly, and monthly basis. By doing this, we can cultivate a relationship with not only our land but with the wider earth, which is what biodynamic farming is all about.
        </p>
        <p class="biodynamic_detail_paragraphs">
            <span>5. Strive For Greater Biodiversity. :</span>
            Remember, as mentioned above, that a biodynamic farm has to leave at least 10% of its land wild and uncultivated. This is not only to help conserve wildlife and endangered species but also to increase the presence of pollinators and beneficial insects, which will ultimately help improve your yields.
        </p>
        <p class="biodynamic_detail_paragraphs">
            <span>6. Produce Your Own Fertility On-Site. :</span>
            A biodynamic farm aims to be a fully self-contained and self-sufficient entity. This means producing everything on site, including compost. A farm is measured by the number of valuable plants it produces, which is dependent on the fertility of the soil. <br> Biodynamic farms aim to gain maximum fertility by using practices such as rotation grazing, producing green manure, and using nitrogen-fixing crops.
        </p>
        <p class="biodynamic_detail_paragraphs">
            <span>7. Homeopathic Interventions :</span>
            Crops are treated with homeopathic sprays, of which there are 8 in the biodynamic system. They are also used to create compost and save crops from fungus. Each spray is heavily diluted and is utilized to dynamize the whole process.
        </p>
        <p class="biodynamic_detail_paragraphs">
            <span>8. Integration Of Livestock. :</span>
            Biodynamic farming views life holistically, and as such aims for greater integration in every aspect of farm management. Farm animals are not separate from crops, but rather they are viewed as part of the team. It also helps to maintain the self-sufficiency of the farm.
        </p>
        <p class="biodynamic_detail_paragraphs">
            <span>9. Water Conservation. :</span>
            If you need to irrigate your crops, make sure this is done efficiently. Natural wetlands need to be protected by a buffer of a minimum of 25 feet. Solar pumps, air pumps, or nose pumps are some good alternatives to less sustainable ways of accessing your water.
        </p>
        <p class="biodynamic_detail_paragraphs">
            <span>10. Control Insects, Pests, And Weed :</span>
            By keeping a biodiverse farm and practicing crop rotation, you’ll find you greatly reduce your plants’ susceptibility to pests and diseases. By planting at the correct times you’ll also find a reduction in problems. You can consult the biodynamic calendar for this information. <br> Monitoring your land over time will give you insight into the life-cycle of the pests that will allow you to deal with them effectively.
        </p>
        <p class="biodynamic_detail_paragraphs">
            <span>11. Be Dynamic. :</span>
            Biodynamic farming is different from the conventional method of farming as it retains a strong sense of dynamism behind it.
